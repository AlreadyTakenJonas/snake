class Snake:
    """
    This class is gonna control the snake and the gameboard. Each turn you call a method and tell the class where to move the snake. This class shall take care of collision detection, the game board, the position of the snake, spawning the apple and keeping track of the score. It should do everything except run the game loop, check the user input and render the game. This function should only run the backend. A seperate script shall collect the user input, render the game to the screen and implement the while loop to run the game.
